A traditional tic-tac-toe application featuring responsive UI and user authentication. The game board itself is created using CSS and flexbox, with interactive elements enabled through jQuery. As players take turns the game board updates with user messages and game updates. ExpressJS is used to enable the REST API and update game status/win tallies as well as user creation and authentication.

Future iterations of this game will include implementing a simple AI using the minimax algorithm that users can test their skills against.
